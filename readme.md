Orbit and SurfaceStructures are proud to present you the all new product line for Kerbals who want

This mod adds several new parts that are designed to be used in a planetery base for the Kerbals.This  
includes Habitats, Greenhouse, Laboratory, a Cupola derivative, Command-Center and others. It is  
designed to fit with the other stock parts and feel as "Kerbal" as possible.

### Looking for help:  
If anyone is interested to translate KPBS into Japanese ![](http://i.imgur.com/M93S44Z.png), French ![](https://i.imgur.com/r27hbde.png) or Brazilian Portuguese ![](https://i.imgur.com/bYvpByj.png), please let me know!

You can find all the texts that need translation here: [KPBS Texts](https://github.com/Nils277/KerbalPlanetaryBaseSystems/tree/master/Translation). (5916 Words)  

***Important***: Please contact me before you start with the translation. It already happend more than once that  
multiple persons worked on a translation for the same texts and therefore their efforts were in vain.
